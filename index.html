            <p>My MSc was with Greg Slabaugh and Vineet Batta at QMUL. Did my UG with Dhanalakshmi Samiappan and Debashis Nandi (NIT-D) at SRM.</p>
            <p>I am always exploring London's food scene or breaking down complex rhyme schemes in rap. In school, I represented my country in futsal and debated nationally.</p>
            <p>I regularly mentor students (see In2Stem!) and researchers. Please reach out! There are many who have supported my research.</p>
